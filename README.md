# WS2812B RGB LED Strip Controller

This project is designed to control a WS2812B RGB LED strip using an ATtiny85 microcontroller. The code is written in C and optimized for AVR microcontrollers
which uses 8MHz crystal. Datasheet is available on [site](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812B.pdf).

## Features

- Control individual LEDs or the entire strip.
- Support for RGB color blending.
- Efficient signal timing compatible with WS2812B data protocol.
- Uses the internal 8MHz oscillator of the ATtiny85, with precise timing optimizations.

    
    
## Prerequisites

### Hardware

- **Microcontroller**: ATtiny85 or any AVR based MCU
- **LED Strip**: WS2812B
- **Power Supply**: 5V DC for the LED strip (and 5V or 3.3V for MCU).
- **Resistor**: ~330Î© resistor between the ATtiny85 output pin and the WS2812B data pin.
